# Automation of Input Form Submit

I have automated the Input Form Submit Form from "https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-playground/"   Web Page.

To run this file in your side ,follow following steps.

1) Download the zip file or clone the code in your desired directory.
   
3) To clone a git repository, you need to:
   
=> Find the main page of the repository on GitHub.com and click Code.

=>Copy the URL for the repository.

=>Open a terminal or command line on your local machine.

=>Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

=>Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

3) After that In Visual Studio Code terminal , give the file path where the file has been kept.

    For Example :- D:\Downloads\Frost> 

4) You can open Cypress from your project root one of the following ways:

```bash
npx cypress open
```
  After a moment, the Cypress Launchpad will open
